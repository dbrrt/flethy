Headless content management systems are an enormous facilitation in the maintenance of content on websites, SaaS products or even e-mails. Not only do these systems allow the use of a central repository for managing content, but it also helps maintain accountability. Departments responsible for content (such as marketing) can change content without accessing developer resources. On the other hand, development teams can focus completely on product implementation and only need to connect to the API.

One service in this category is ButterCMS. Structures and content can be easily managed via the frontend, and a powerful and fast API allows the data to be read out.

flethy offers a very simple way to read content from ButterCMS. Just configure the node accordingly with the query information and the API token and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
