NFTs can be used not only to implement profile pictures, but also to cover a number of interesting use cases. These include, for example, access to a community or a ticket for an event. NFTs belong to a contract on the blockchain and return various metadata, such as owners, attributes or references to media. To avoid searching for NFTs directly on the blockchain, products exist that simplify the process of reading data.

One service in this category is Basement.dev. A GraphQL endpoint allows for easy querying of NFTs.

flethy offers a very simple way to query NFTs with Basement.dev. Just configure the node accordingly with the query information and the API key and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
