Discord is a chat and voice communication platform designed for communities and groups. It offers features such as text, voice, and video chat, as well as the ability to create and join servers (communities). Discord servers can be customized with roles and permissions for different users, and can also include channels for different topics or purposes. Discord is popular among gamers and other online communities, but can be used for a variety of purposes. Discord is available as a web app and as a downloadable app for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android.
