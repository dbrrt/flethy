Every SaaS product aims at operational excellence. The goal is to quickly identify problems in live operations and initiate appropriate actions. Tools help to manage everything around an incident: Gather and aggregate information, define action items, clarify responsibilities and more. With many integrations, these tools can be easily integrated into a company's regular operations.

One service in this category is Incident.io. Integrations and structures can be managed from the front end, and a powerful API allows incident management to be integrated with all necessary tools.

flethy offers a very simple way to list incidents with Incident.io. Just configure the node accordingly with the payload and the API token and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
