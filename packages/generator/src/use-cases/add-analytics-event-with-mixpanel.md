A product should always solve a customer problem. During development, however, it is not always clear how users will use and deploy their own product. All possible areas can be optimized so that users reach their goal faster or understand the product better. In order to have a solid basis on facts and not to use gut feeling, there are analysis tools that help to get a better view on the different topics.

One service in this category is Mixpanel. Mixpanel can receive events from a web application as well as from a backend system. It is all about sending relevant events to Mixpanel. In addition, additional attributes can be stored as context, and an event can be assigned to a specific entity, such as a user.

flethy provides a very simple way to send events to the Mixpanel API. Just configure the node accordingly with the event information and the API key and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
