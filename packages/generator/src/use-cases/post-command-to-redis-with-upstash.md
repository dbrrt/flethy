Upstash offers a serverless environment for Redis, Kafka and QStash. Databases can be managed via console and API. An API allows easy access to the databases. Customers therefore do not have to worry about provisioning and operation, but can concentrate completely on using the databases.

flethy offers a very simple way to post commands to Redis via Upstash. Just configure the node accordingly with the token and the commands and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
