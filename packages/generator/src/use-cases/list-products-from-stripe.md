A payment processing platform is a software or service that enables businesses and individuals to accept and process electronic payments, such as credit card transactions, online or in person. Payment processing platforms typically provide a range of features and tools to help businesses manage their transactions, including the ability to create custom payment forms that can be embedded on a website or app, support for multiple currencies and payment methods, fraud detection and prevention tools, and integrations with other software and services. Payment processing platforms may also offer services such as invoicing, billing, and accounting, and may support various payment types such as ACH direct debit and recurring payments. Payment processing platforms are commonly used by e-commerce businesses, service providers, and other organizations that need to accept and process payments from customers or clients.

One service in this category is Stripe. Products, prices, coupons and more can be easily managed via the dashboard, and a powerful API allows the data to be read out.

flethy offers a very simple way to read products from Stripe. Just configure the node accordingly with the query information and the API key and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
