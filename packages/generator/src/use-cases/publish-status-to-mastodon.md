There is no way around social media platforms. Publish status updates, comment, consume news, interact, collaborate, and many more. Many activities can be published via different platforms, as each platform attracts its own target groups.

One platform in this segment is Mastodon. An API allows to automate many actions.

flethy offers a very simple way to publish content to Mastodon. Just configure the node accordingly with the API token and the content and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
