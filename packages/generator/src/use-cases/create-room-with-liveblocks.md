Liveblocks.io is a web-based visual programming platform that allows users to create, share, and collaborate on interactive web projects without writing code. It utilizes a drag-and-drop interface and pre-built blocks to simplify the development process and make it accessible to non-technical users. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as creating interactive websites, games, and data visualizations.

flethy offers a very simple way to create rooms with liveblocks. Just configure the node accordingly with the payload and the API key and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
