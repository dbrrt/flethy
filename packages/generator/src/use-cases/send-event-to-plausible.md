It collects data on website traffic and usage patterns and generates reports on various metrics, including pageviews, unique visitors, and referrers. Unlike traditional analytics tools, Plausible doesn't collect any personal data and is designed to protect the privacy of its users and their visitors. The service is open-source and offers a self-hosted option for those who want more control over their data.
