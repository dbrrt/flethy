Bug tracking is the process of identifying, recording, and resolving defects or issues in a software application or system. It helps teams identify and fix problems, improve the quality of their product, and ensure that it meets the requirements of the user or customer. Bug tracking involves identifying the problem, reproducing the error, determining the root cause, and finding a solution. This process can be done manually or with the help of specialized bug tracking software, which allows teams to track and manage issues in a central location. Effective bug tracking can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a development team and ensure the timely delivery of a high-quality product.
