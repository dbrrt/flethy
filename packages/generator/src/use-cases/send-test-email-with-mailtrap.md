Mailtrap is a fake email server for development teams to test their applications' email functionality without sending real emails to customers. It provides a safe environment for developers to catch and debug emails during the development process. It simulates an email server and catches all outgoing emails and displays them in the Mailtrap interface for review. The tool also helps to avoid sending test emails to the wrong recipients or spamming them.

flethy offers a very simple way to send a test email with Mailtrap. Just configure the node accordingly with the parameters and the API token and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
