Privacy.com is a service that provides virtual credit card numbers that can be used for online purchases. These numbers can be linked to your actual credit card, but they can be used to protect your personal information and keep it private. You can create a new virtual credit card number for each online purchase, which can help prevent fraud and identity theft.

flethy offers a very simple way to list cards from Privacy.com. Just configure the node accordingly with the query params and the API kay and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
