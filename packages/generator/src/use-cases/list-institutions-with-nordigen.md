Open banking is a financial system in which banks and other financial institutions are required to share data and functionality with approved third parties, such as financial technology (fintech) companies and other banks. The goal of open banking is to increase competition in the financial sector by allowing new entrants to the market to offer innovative products and services that leverage the data and functionality of existing financial institutions.

One service in this category is Nordigen. A powerful API allows interacting with banks in a very easy way.
