Dune is a data platform widely used by crypto-asset investors and analysts to research individual projects, specific sectors (e.g. non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi)) and blockchain ecosystems.

flethy provides a very simple way to execute queries with Dune. Just configure the node accordingly with the event information and the API key and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
