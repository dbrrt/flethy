Cronitor is a website monitoring service that helps you keep an eye on your critical applications, services, and endpoints. It provides real-time alerting and reporting on uptime, downtime, and performance issues. Cronitor tracks the availability and response times of your website, API, or any HTTP endpoint. It works by creating unique URLs that are monitored for availability and performance, and it provides detailed reports and charts that show you how your site is performing over time. You can set up alerts to notify you via email, SMS, Slack, or webhooks if there are issues with your site, so you can take action to resolve them quickly.

flethy offers a very simple way to send an event to Cronitor. Just configure the node accordingly with the event parameter and the API token and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
