Icons are an essential part of web applications. Icon libraries provide glossy icons, so you don't have to design each icon yourself.

One service in this category is TheNounProject. If you want to retrieve all icons from a collection for internal tools, this can be done very easily via the API.

flethy provides a very simple way to retrieve icons from the TheNounProject API. Just configure the node accordingly with the collection Id and the credentials and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
