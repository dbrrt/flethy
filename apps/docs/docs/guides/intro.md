# Introduction to flethy

The integration and connection of different services is part of every product. Whether it is the integration of communication platforms, CRM systems, CMS, or other services, these services are needed to perform certain tasks that are not part of the core business of the product.

This is where flethy comes into play and simplifies and accelerates the integration of services. flethy has over 250 integrations and more are being added all the time. This means that a new service can be integrated very quickly.

flethy consists of two main components that can be used in projects:

- Connectors
- Flow

The Connectors form the different integrations, the Flow package can connect these integrations together to execute a flow.

These flows can eventually be deployed and executed in the cloud.
