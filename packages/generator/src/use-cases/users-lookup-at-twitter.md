Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to send and receive short messages called "tweets." Tweets are limited to 280 characters and can include text, links, and photos or videos. Users can interact with each other by following, liking, and commenting on tweets, and can also participate in real-time conversations using hashtags.

flethy offers a very simple way to lookup users at Twitter. Just configure the node accordingly with the credentials and the username and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
